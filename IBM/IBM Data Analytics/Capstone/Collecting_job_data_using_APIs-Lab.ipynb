Daar kom jij in beeld.</p>\\n<h2>Mooi werk</h2>\\n<p>Op jouw bord ligt de ontwikkeling van apps voor docenten, studenten en medewerkers. En de studenten zijn jouw grootste uitdaging. Zij zijn kritisch en willen de nieuwste technologieën en mobile/native apps. Aan jou de taak om daaraan te voldoen. Dat doe je niet alleen. Je werkt in een scrumteam, samen met een Product Owner, Scrum master, Tester, UX Designer en meerdere collega Developers. Samen brengen jullie concepten en ideeën tot leven in Mendix.
